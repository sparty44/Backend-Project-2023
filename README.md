# Backend-Project-2023

# Details

This project was done to demonstrate to a potential employer that this profile's owner has Backend/API knowledge and ability. The goal was to create an API and related backend flow for a table on the frontend that displays employee data. 

I was to assume that the UI elements were already created and all that was needed was the backend flow to retrieve all employee's based on a query, sort, or pagination event.

To accomplish this, I created a controller method, service method, repo method, db entity file, and other associated files that if plugged into an Angular framework code base would allow the storage and retrieval of "employee" data. 

For further context, I was told to not worry about setting up a whole working enviroment for this assignment. Thus, this code is based on my previous employment enviroment and would need some minor tweaking based to plug into another workplace's code base. 

The enviroment this is designed to work in;

node v14.17
Angular v12.2.16
typescript v4.3.5

PACKAGES
@angular-devkit/core v10.2.1
rxjs v6.6.7
